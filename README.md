# [Wallpaper_Collection] for the [MiSTer Platform](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki)
This is a collection of wallpapers that I've discovered and edited for my own use. 

These are video preset files you can use to easily configure a core's video settings. These presets present an idealized version how a game platform's visuals appeared when it was new and provides you a starting point to make your own presets. Have fun!



## Installation
Download [all presets](https://github.com/RGarciaLago/VIDEO-PRESETS-by-Robby/tree/main/Presets) to the `/media/fat/wallpapers/` folder on your SD card.

### Updates
You can automatically download and get latest with the MiSTer update script and [update_all](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer) by adding the following text to `/media/fat/downloader.ini`:
```ini
[RGarciaLago/Wallpaper_Collection]
db_url = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RGarciaLago/Wallpaper_Collection/db/db.json.zip
```


## Usage
If you're not familiar with the process of adding wallpapers then follow the instructions below:
1. One the root of your micro SD card (`//media/fat`), create a folder called **wallpaper**.
3. Remove the menu.jpg/menu.png file (if present) from the root of the micro SD card.
4. Press `F1` to cycle through the default images until it displays one of your custom wallpapers.
5. Every time your restart your MiSTer, a new wallpaper will be randomly selected.

You can have different wallpaper folders per different ini; please see the [Wiki_MiSTer Customizing](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Wiki_MiSTer/wiki/Customizing) page for more info.
