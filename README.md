# [Wallpaper_Collection] for the [MiSTer Platform](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki)
##### ‚ùó ***None of the art or photos in this repository are my own. These were found online in public databases and all credit goes to the original artist, whoever they may be.***
This is a collection of **1080p** wallpapers that I've collected and edited for my own use. Every single wallpaper has been altered so that they appear correctly and take into account the MiSTer logo.


## Installation
Download all [wallpapers](https://github.com/RGarciaLago/Wallpaper_Collection/tree/main/wallpapers) to the `/media/fat/wallpapers/` (root folder) on your SD card. Remove the **menu.jpg/menu.png** file from the root folder of the micro SD card if those files exist.

### Updates
You can automatically download and get latest with the MiSTer update script and [update_all](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer) by adding the following text to `/media/fat/downloader.ini`:
```ini
[RGarciaLago/Wallpaper_Collection]
db_url = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RGarciaLago/Wallpaper_Collection/db/db.json.zip
```


## Usage
If this is your first time using custom wallpapers, then you'll need to swap your MiSTer's background to custom wallpapers. To do that, you'll need a keyboard attached and on the main menu, press `F1` to cycle through the default backgrounds until it displays one of the custom wallpapers. Every time you restart the MiSTer, a new wallpaper will be randomly selected.

The amount of time the OSD is displayed can be changed with the `osd_timeout` setting in your [MiSTer.ini](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/blob/master/MiSTer.ini). Additionally, you can show or hide the MiSTer FPGA logo by changing the `logo` setting in the same MiSTer.ini. For more information please visit the [Wiki_MiSTer Customizing](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Wiki_MiSTer/wiki/Customizing) page.
